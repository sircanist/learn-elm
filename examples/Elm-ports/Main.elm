{- Defining ports
   Here we are going to define ports where our elm application

port play : String -> Cmd msg



-- we will send a message to stop the current audio


port stop : () -> Cmd msg



-- we will send a message to pause the current audio


port pause : () -> Cmd msg



-- we will receive a message from javascript when an audio ends


port ended : (() -> msg) -> Sub msg
